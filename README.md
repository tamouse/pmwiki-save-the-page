# Save The Page - a PmWiki Recipe for capturing web pages into wiki pages

## Obtain

Get "Save The Page"" from
[GitHub](git@github.com:tamouse/pmwiki-save-the-page) or download from
(the Cookbook)[http://www.pmwiki.org/wiki/Cookbook/SaveThePage].

## Abandoned

I no longer work on PmWiki. Although this worked when I last used it,
it's very much out of date, and probably (maybe?) won't work with the
latest version of PHP or PmWiki.

Feel free to use it as you wish.
