SaveThePage - save a web page to your wiki, similar to evernote clipping

SaveThePage will either save the full contents of the page, the
current selection or just the URL, converting it's HTML into PmWiki
format (stripping scripts, styles, header info, etc).

It will also save meta page info, such as the document title, last
modification date, and URL.

Install SaveThePage by unzipping the package into the root of your
pmwiki. Files will be saved under cookbook and pub.

Configuring and activating SaveThePage are found in the newly created
Site.SaveThePage wiki page.
